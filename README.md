A tool to automate flashing stock Motorola Moto G android firmware with mfastboot.

It was created to fix an annoying issue which prevent installation of Magisk on my unlocked device to allow "root" app backup, without Google Backup, and it worked!

I found the stock ROMs at https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-4-4-4-stock-flashable-zip-stock-motorola-kitkat-rom-collection.2854688/ useful for fixing my old MOTO G XT1033.
